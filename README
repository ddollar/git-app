If you are on a Mac and you are having problems installing the ultraviolet gem
required by this application, do the following:

  * Go to http://www.geocities.jp/kosako3/oniguruma/ and download the latest
    tarball for oniguruma
  * Expand the archive
  * ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  * make && sudo make install

Installation of the oniguruma gem (and thus ultraviolet that depends on it) should now succeed. Yay. I apologize for the craptasticness of this process,
but the alternative was to have you install Python.
